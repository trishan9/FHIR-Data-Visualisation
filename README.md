# Express-App-Starter with Next.js Frontend

This project is a full-stack web application with an Express.js backend and a Next.js frontend. It uses D3.js for data visualization, 
Tailwind CSS for styling, and other modern tools and libraries to provide a rich user experience.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Project Structure

- `backend`: The Express.js server application.
- `frontend`: The Next.js client application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Setting Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd backend
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the server:
   npm run dev


### Setting Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd ../frontend
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the server:
   npm run dev


Now you can access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend will be serving at the designated port 
(usually `http://localhost:3001` or `http://localhost:3000/api` depending on your setup).

## Building and Running in Production

To build and run the application in production, follow these steps:

### Backend

1. Build the application:
   cd backend
   npm run build
2. Start the server:
   npm start


### Frontend

1. Build the application:
   cd frontend
   npm run build
2. Start the server:
   npm start
